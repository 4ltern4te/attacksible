# Please only use postgresql bound to a TCP port.
# Only postgresql is supportable for metasploit-framework
# these days. (No SQLite, no MySQL).
#
# To set up a metasploit database, follow the directions hosted at:
# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Metasploit_Postgres_Setup (Works on
# essentially any Linux distro, not just Fedora)
development: &pgsql
  adapter: postgresql
  database: msf
  username: msf
  password: msf
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5

# You will often want to seperate your databases between dev
# mode and prod mode. Absent a production db, though, defaulting
# to dev is pretty sensible for many developer-users.
production: &production
  <<: *pgsql

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
#
# Note also, sqlite3 is totally unsupported by Metasploit now.
test:
  <<: *pgsql
  database: metasploit_framework_test
  username: metasploit_framework_test
